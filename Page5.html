        <h2><strong>What is Data Encapsulation?</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In a computer network, to enable data transmission from one computer to another, the network devices send messages in the form of packets. 
        These packets are then added with the IP header by the OSI reference model layer.The Data Link Layer encapsulates each packet in a 
        frame that contains the hardware address of the source and the destination computer. If a destination computer is on the remote
        network then the frames are routed through a gateway or router to the destination computer.Data encapsulation, also known as data hiding, 
        is the mechanism whereby the implementation details of a class are kept hidden from the user. The user can only perform a restricted set of operations on the hidden members of the class by executing special functions commonly called methods. Data encapsulation may refer to:
        <ul>
            <li>The wrapping of private data in classes in object-oriented programming languages: see Encapsulation (object-oriented programming), 
        information hiding, separation of concerns</li>
            <li>The wrapping of network data by a lower layer in the OSI model into a single unit where
        a higher layer can extract the relevant data: see Encapsulation (networking)</li>
        </ul>
