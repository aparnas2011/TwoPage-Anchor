        <h2><strong>What is a Node?</strong></h2>
        <p><Strong>Answer:</Strong>Two or more computers are connected directly by an optical fiber or any other cable. 
        A node is a point where a connection is established. It is a network component that is used to send, receive and forward 
        the electronic information.A device connected to a network is also termed as Node. Let’s consider that in a network there are
        2 computers, 2 printers, and a server are connected, then we can say that there are five nodes on the network.In telecommunications 
        networks, a node (Latin: nodus, ‘knot’) is either a redistribution point or a communication endpoint. The definition of a node depends on
        the network and protocol layer referred to. A physical network node is an electronic device that is attached to a network, and is capable
        of creating, receiving, or transmitting information over a communication channel.[1]
        A passive distribution point such as a distribution frame or patch panel is consequently not a node.</p>
