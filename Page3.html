        <h2><Strong>What are Router</Strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong>The router is a network device that connects two or more network segments. It is used to transfer information from the 
        source to the destination.
        Routers send the information in terms of data packets and when these data packets are forwarded from one router to another router
        then the router reads the network address in the packets and identifies the destination network.A router[a] is a networking device 
        that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. Data sent 
        through the internet, such as a web page or email, is in the form of data packets. A packet is typically forwarded from one router 
        to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork (e.g. the Internet) until it reaches its destination node.
        A router is connected to two or more data lines from different IP networks.[b] When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, 
        the router reads the network address information in the packet header to determine the ultimate destination. Then, using information 
        in its routing table or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.</p>
