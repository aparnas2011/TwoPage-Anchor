        <h2><strong>What is a Firewall?</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong>Firewall is a network security system that is used to protect computer networks from unauthorized access. 
        It prevents malicious access from outside to the computer network.A firewall can also be built to grant limited access to outside users.
        The firewall consists of a hardware device, software program or a combined configuration of both. All the messages 
        that route through the firewall are examined by specific security criteria and the messages which meet the criteria are successfully 
        traversed through the network or else those messages are blocked.The term firewall originally referred to a wall intended to confine
        a fire within a line of adjacent buildings.[3] Later uses refer to similar structures, such as the metal sheet separating the engine compartment of a vehicle or aircraft from the passenger compartment. The term was applied in the late 1980s to network technology[4] that emerged when the Internet was fairly new in terms of its global use and connectivity.[5] The predecessors to firewalls for network security were routers used in the late 1980s. Because they already segregated networks, routers could apply filtering to packets crossing them.[6]
        Before it was used in real-life computing, the term appeared in the 1983 computer-hacking movie WarGames, and possibly inspired its 
        later use.</p>
