        <h2><strong>What is a Network?</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong>Network is defined as a set of devices connected to each other using a physical transmission medium.For Example, A computer network is a group of computers connected with each other to communicate and share information and resources
        like hardware, data, and software. In a network, nodes are used to connect two or more networks.A computer network is a group 
        of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located 
        on or provided by the network nodes. The interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of telecommunication network
        technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network 
        topologies.The nodes of a computer network may include personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or other specialised or 
        general-purpose hosts. They are identified by hostnames and network addresses. Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes, 
        rarely changed after initial assignment. Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols 
        such as the Internet Protocol.</p>
